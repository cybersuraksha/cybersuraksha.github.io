                The term cybersecurity refers to techniques and practices designed to protect digital data. The data
                that is
                stored, transmitted or used on an information system. After all, that is what criminal wants, data.
                The
                network, servers, computers are just mechanisms to get to the data. Effective cybersecurity reduces
                the risk
                of cyber-attacks and protects organizations and individuals from the unauthorized exploitation of
                systems,
                networks, and technologies. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability, also known as the CIA
                triad, is a
                model designed to guide companies and organizations to form their security policies. Technically,
                cybersecurity means protecting information from unauthorized access, unauthorized modification, and
                unauthorized deletion in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

                Generally the cyber security basics consists of 4 major points - <br>

                    <li style="color: rgb(62, 158, 142);"><b><u>Password Management</u> :</b></li>
                    <p> Since passwords are meant to keep the files and data secret and safe so it is prevented the
                        unauthorized
                        access, password management refers to the practices and set of rules or principles or
                        standards
                        that
                        out
                        must follow or at least try to seek help from in order to be a good/strong password and
                        along
                        with
                        its
                        storage and management for the future requirements.
                        <br>
                        There are a lot of good practices that we can follow to generate a strong password and also
                        the
                        ways
                        to
                        manage them.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strong and long passwords:</strong> A minimum length of 8 to 12 characters long,
                            also it
                            should contain at least
                            three different character sets (e.g., uppercase characters, lowercase characters,
                            numbers,
                            or
                            symbols)
                        <li><strong>Password Encryption:</strong> Using irreversible end-to-end encryption is
                            recommended.
                            In
                            this way, the password
                            remains safe even if it ends up in the hands of cybercriminals.
                        <li><strong>Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Adding some security questions and a
                            phone
                            number that would be used
                            to confirm that it is indeed you who is trying to log in will enhance the security of
                            your
                            password.
                        <li><strong>Make the password pass the test:</strong> Yes, put your password through some
                            testing
                            tools
                            that you might find
                            online in order to ensure that it falls under the strong and safe password category.
                        <li><strong>Avoid updating passwords frequently:</strong> Though it is advised or even made
                            mandatory to
                            update or change
                            your password as frequently as in 60 or 90 days.

                    <p>
                        Email security is a term for describing different procedures and techniques for protecting
                        email
                        accounts, content, and communication against unauthorized access, loss or compromise. Email
                        is
                        often
                        used to spread malware, spam and phishing attacks. Attackers use deceptive messages to
                        entice
                        recipients
                        to part with sensitive information, open attachments or click on hyperlinks that install
                        malware
                        on
                        the
                        victim's device. Email is also a common entry point for attackers looking to gain a foothold
                        in
                        an
                        enterprise network and obtain valuable company data. Email encryption involves encrypting,
                        or
                        disguising, the content of email messages to protect potentially sensitive information from
                        being
                        read
                        by anyone other than intended recipients. Email encryption often includes authentication.
                        <br>
                        One of the first best practices that organizations should put into effect is implementing a
                        secure
                        email
                        gateway. An email gateway scans and processes all incoming and outgoing email and makes sure
                        that
                        threats are not allowed in. Because attacks are increasingly sophisticated, standard
                        security
                        measures,
                        such as blocking known bad file attachments, are no longer effective. A better solution is
                        to
                        deploy
                        a
                        secure email gateway that uses a multi-layered approach. <br>
                        <center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/xd2fb5Q3/email-security.png" width="50%"><br></center>
                        The security of email can depend on the user. Training employees on appropriate email usage
                        and
                        knowing
                        what is a good and bad email is also an important best practice for email security. Users
                        may
                        receive a
                        malicious email that slips through the secure email gateway, so it's critical that they
                        understand
                        what
                        to look for. Most often they are exposed to phishing attacks, which have telltale signs.
                        Training
                        helps
                        employees spot and report on these types of emails.

                    <p>
                        A connection to the Internet provides access to information and enables communication
                        services
                        such
                        as
                        email and online banking. The Internet enables people to work effectively and efficiently in
                        a
                        convenient manner saving time and resources.
                        <br>
                        Some tips for safe browsing of the Internet include:
                        <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Visit only legitimate and trusted websites for safe and secure browsing
                        <li>Use discretion and follow safe practices to download files or software from the internet
                            as
                            well
                            as
                            accessing online services using personal information
                        <li>Use caution when sending and receiving emails, to protect from phishing & spamming
                        <li>Be aware of the harm caused by inappropriate internet browsing
                    </ol><br>
                    Cybercriminals also use the Internet to gather personal, confidential and financial information.

                    Many of the internet's most popular services-email, social media, photo and video sharing-may be
                    free,
                    but
                    that doesn't mean they come without a cost. What appears to be free is paid for by the shared
                    data.
                    Cybercriminals will use the shared data to spam people with advertisements, other unsafe
                    material,
                    commit
                    fraud1, theft and to perform other illegal activities. <br><br>
                    Some good practices include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Never use of unsecure Wi-Fi access points when connecting for banking/financial
                            transaction.
                        <li>Use appropriate firewalls and strong passwords to keep your home computers and mobile

                    <p>
                        Social media has become a prime target for cybercrime. All organizations should take
                        appropriate
                        measures to be cyber-safe, and users, too, should protect their personal information to
                        avoid
                        any
                        misuse. Cyberspace is becoming a significant area for crimes, so there is a need for
                        comprehensive
                        collaboration among nations to work together and combat these social network crimes and
                        social
                        media
                        cyber attacks, which are a continuously gowning menace.
                        <br>
                        As social media has grown by leaps and bounds, it has brought various benefits
                        simultaneously
                        and
                        has
                        posed serious social media cyber security concerns. It also acts as a vulnerable platform to
                        be
                        exploited by hackers. Some issues associated are pointed out below.
                    <ol>
                        <li><u>Privacy of Data</u>: Users share their personal information on social media, which
                            can
                            cause
                            privacy
                            breaches. It can also sometimes cause personal data loss or instigate hackers to
                            leverage
                            the
                            same
                            for
                            malicious reasons. For example, a user's information can be viewed by everyone if the
                            user's
                            default
                            setting is public.
                        <li><u>Data Mining</u>: We all leave a data trail behind on the internet. When someone
                            creates a
                            new
                            social media
                            account and provides details such as date of birth, name, location, and personal habits,
                            and
                            without
                            our
                            knowledge, all these data are leveraged and shared with third-party for targeting
                            advertising.
                            It
                            can
                            cause security concerns as third-party may collect real-time updates on the user's
                            location.
                        <li><u>Virus and Malware Attacks</u>: Malware and viruses quite often find a way into the
                            computer
                            system through
                            annoying ads. Once gaining access to the network, the attacker steals confidential data
                            or
                            causes
                            complete disruption to the computer system. This often causes the loss of all kinds of
                            data
                            -
                            personal,
                            professional, financial, etc.
                        <li><u>Issues involving the use of 3rd Party Applications</u>: Most applications nowadays
                            ask
                            permission
                            from users
                            to access personal information such as contacts, pictures, and current geographic
                            location
                            before

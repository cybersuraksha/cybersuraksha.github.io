                Ethical hacking is an authorized practice of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or
                organization's infrastructure and bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and
                threats in a network. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that
                malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They can improve the security footprint to withstand
                attacks better or divert them.<br>
                The company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security engineers to perform such
                activities in order to test the system's defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is
                planned, approved, and more importantly, legal.
                <br><br>
            <div id="ethhack">
                The term 'Hacker' was coined to describe experts who used their skills to re-develop mainframe
                systems,
                increasing their efficiency and allowing them to multi-task. Nowadays, the term routinely describes
                skilled programmers who gain unauthorized access into computer systems by exploiting weaknesses or
                using
                bugs, motivated either by malice or mischief. For example, a hacker can create algorithms to crack
                passwords, penetrate networks, or even disrupt network services. The primary motive of
                malicious/unethical hacking involves stealing valuable information or financial gain. However, not
                all
                hacking is bad. This brings us to the second type of hacking: <strong>Ethical hacking</strong>. <br>
                Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can
                exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze the information to figure out ways to strengthen the
                security of the system/network/applications. By doing so, they can improve the security footprint so
                that it can better withstand attacks or divert them.
                Ethical hackers are hired by organizations to look into the vulnerabilities of their systems and
                networks and develop solutions to prevent data breaches. Consider it a high-tech permutation of the
                old
                saying “It takes a thief to catch a thief.” <br><br>

                They check for key vulnerabilities include but are not limited to:
                <ol>
                    <li>Injection attacks</li>
                    <li>Changes in security settings</li>
                    <li>Exposure of sensitive data</li>
                    <li>Breach in authentication protocols</li>
                    <li>Components used in the system or network that may be used as access points</li>
                </ol><br>
                The practice of ethical hacking is called “White Hat” hacking, and those who perform it are called
                White Hat
                hackers. In contrast to Ethical Hacking, “Black Hat” hacking describes practices involving security
                violations. The Black Hat hackers use illegal techniques to compromise the system or destroy
                information.
                <br>
                <strong>Ethical Hackers must follow certain guidelines in order to perform hacking legally. A good
                    hacker
                    knows his
                    or her responsibility and adheres to all of the ethical guidelines. Here are the most important
                    rules of
                    Ethical Hacking:</strong>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>An ethical hacker must seek authorization from the organization that owns the system.
                        Hackers should
                        obtain
                        complete approval before performing any security assessment on the system or network. </li>
                    <li>Determine the scope of their assessment and make known their plan to the organization.</li>
                    <li>Report any security breaches and vulnerabilities found in the system or network.</li>
                    <li>Keep their discoveries confidential. As their purpose is to secure the system or network,
                        ethical
                        hackers
                        should agree to and respect their non-disclosure agreement.</li>
                    <li>Erase all traces of the hack after checking the system for any vulnerability. It prevents
                        malicious
                        hackers
                        from entering the system through the identified loopholes.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4>KEY BENEFITS OF ETHICAL HACKING :</h4>
                Learning ethical hacking involves studying the mindset and techniques of black hat hackers and
                testers to
                learn how to identify and correct vulnerabilities within networks. Studying ethical hacking can be
                applied
                by security pros across industries and in a multitude of sectors. This sphere includes network
                defender,
                risk management, and quality assurance tester.
                <br>
                However, the most obvious benefit of learning ethical hacking is its potential to inform and improve
                and
                defend corporate networks. The primary threat to any organization's security is a hacker: learning,
                understanding, and implementing how hackers operate can help network defenders prioritize potential
                risks
                and learn how to remediate them best. Additionally, getting ethical hacking training or
                certifications can
                benefit those who are seeking a new role in the security realm or those wanting to demonstrate
                skills and
                quality to their organization.
                <h4>SKILLS REQUIRED TO BECOME AN ETHICAL HACKER :</h4>
                An ethical hacker should have in-depth knowledge about all the systems, networks, program codes,
                security
                measures, etc. to perform hacking efficiently. Some of these skills include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Knowledge of programming - It is required for security professionals working in the field of
                        application
                        security and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
                    <li>Scripting knowledge - This is required for professionals dealing with network-based attacks
                        and
                        host-based
                        attacks.
                    <li>Networking skills - This skill is important because threats mostly originate from networks.
                        You
                        should know
                        about all of the devices present in the network, how they are connected, and how to identify
                        if they
                        are
                        compromised.
                    <li>Understanding of databases - Attacks are mostly targeted at databases. Knowledge of database
                        management
                        systems such as SQL will help you to effectively inspect operations carried out in
                        databases.
                    <li>Knowledge of multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, etc.
                    <li>The ability to work with different hacking tools available in the market.
                    <li>Knowledge of search engines and servers.
                </ul>
                <h4>ETHICAL HACKING TECHNIQUES :</h4>
                Ethical hackers generally use the same hacking skills that malicious actors use to attack
                enterprises. They
                use a form of reverse-engineering to imagine scenarios that could compromise business and
                operational data.
                The varied techniques and tools are part of an overall vulnerability assessment the ethical hacker
                performs
                on a client's behalf. <br>

                Some of these hacking techniques include the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>scanning ports to find vulnerabilities with port scanning tools, such as Nmap,
                        Nessus,Wireshark and
                        others,
                        looking at a company's systems, identifying open ports, studying the vulnerabilities of each
                        port
                        and
                        recommending remedial action.
                    <li>scrutinizing patch installation processes to be sure that the updated software doesn't
                        introduce new
                        vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
                    <li>performing network traffic analysis and sniffing by using appropriate tools.
                    <li>attempting to evade intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, honeypots and
                        firewalls.
                    <li>testing methods to detect Structured Query Language injection to ensure malicious hackers
                        can't
                        introduce
                        security exploits that expose sensitive information contained in SQL-based relational
                        databases.
                </ul>

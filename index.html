                    " Nowadays the people are getting more and more dependent on technology and the cyber world. So,
                    with the increasing reliance on technology has resulted in a rise of cybercrime and cyber threats,
                    posing
                    significant risks to personal and corporate data. This website is created to help different
                    organisataions understated how hackers operate and the various techniques they use to penetrate any
                    system for security vulnerabilities and also helps the organistaion to comply with these
                    regulations. Cyber security is a discipline that covers how to defend devices and services from
                    electronic attacks by nefarious actors such as hackers, spammers, and cybercriminals. While some
                    components of cyber security are designed to strike first, most of today's professionals focus more
                    on determining the best way to defend all assets, from computers and smartphones to networks and
                    databases, from attacks. The most common way an organisation protect their system is Ethical
                    hacking. Ethical hacking is used to secure important data from enemies. It works as a safeguard of
                    your computer from blackmail by the people who want to exploit the vulnerability. Using ethical
                    hacking, a company or organization can find out security vulnerability and risks. Ethical hacking
                    can ensure the safety of the nation by preventing cyber-terrorism and terrorist attacks. The trained
                    ethical hackers are the main strength. To ensure the functions of software aptly, ethical hackers
                    can apply quick security tests under extreme and standard conditions. They can identify the weakness
                    of your software security. Using the hacker's perspective, you can look at your security and fix any
                    anomalies before making a problem in the company's success. "

                    The term cybersecurity refers to techniques and practices designed to protect digital data. The data

                    the risk
                    of cyber-attacks and protects organizations and individuals from the unauthorized exploitation of
                    systems,
                    networks, and technologies. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability, also known as the CIA
                    triad, is a
                    model designed to guide companies and organizations to form their security policies. Technically,
                    cybersecurity means protecting information from unauthorized access, unauthorized modification, and
                    unauthorized deletion in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

                            Email security is a term for describing different procedures and techniques for protecting
                            email
                            accounts, content, and communication against unauthorized access, loss or compromise. Email
                            is
                            often
                            used to spread malware, spam and phishing attacks. Attackers use deceptive messages to
                            entice
                            recipients
                            to part with sensitive information, open attachments or click on hyperlinks that install
                            malware
                            on
                            the
                            victim's device. Email is also a common entry point for attackers looking to gain a foothold
                            in
                            an
                            enterprise network and obtain valuable company data. Email encryption involves encrypting,
                            or
                            disguising, the content of email messages to protect potentially sensitive information from
                            being
                            read
                            by anyone other than intended recipients. Email encryption often includes authentication.
                            <br>
                            One of the first best practices that organizations should put into effect is implementing a
                            secure
                            email
                            gateway. An email gateway scans and processes all incoming and outgoing email and makes sure
                            that
                            threats are not allowed in. Because attacks are increasingly sophisticated, standard
                            security
                            measures,
                            such as blocking known bad file attachments, are no longer effective. A better solution is
                            to
                            deploy
                            a
                            secure email gateway that uses a multi-layered approach. <br>

                            The security of email can depend on the user. Training employees on appropriate email usage
                            and
                            knowing
                            what is a good and bad email is also an important best practice for email security. Users
                            may
                            receive a
                            malicious email that slips through the secure email gateway, so it's critical that they
                            understand
                            what
                            to look for. Most often they are exposed to phishing attacks, which have telltale signs.
                            Training
                            helps
                            employees spot and report on these types of emails.

                            Social media has become a prime target for cybercrime. All organizations should take
                            appropriate
                            measures to be cyber-safe, and users, too, should protect their personal information to

                    A cyberattack is any offensive maneuver that targets computer information systems, computer
                    networks, infrastructures, personal computer devices, or smartphones. An attacker is a person or
                    process that attempts to access data, functions, or other restricted areas of the system without
                    authorization, potentially with malicious intent. Depending on the context, cyberattacks can be part
                    of cyber warfare or cyberterrorism. A cyberattack can be employed by sovereign states, individuals,
                    groups, societies or organisations and it may originate from an anonymous source. A product that
                    facilitates a cyberattack is sometimes called a cyber weapon. Cyber attacks have increased with an
                    alarming rate for the last few years. <br><br>
                    Most common cyber threats include- Malware, Phishing, Social engineering attacks, Ransomware, DOS
                    attacks, MITM Attacks, etc.<br><br>

                            Malware is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server,
                            client, or
                            computer network, leak private information, gain
                            unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which
                            unknowingly
                            interferes with the user's computer security and privacy. Researchers tend to classify
                            malware into one or more sub-types (i.e. computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware,
                            spyware,
                            adware, rogue software, wiper and keyloggers).

                            Malware poses serious problems to individuals and businesses on the Internet. According to
                            Symantec's 2018 Internet Security Threat Report (ISTR), malware variants number has
                            increased to
                            669,947,865 in 2017, which is twice as many malware variants as in 2016. Cybercrime, which
                            includes
                            malware attacks as well as other crimes committed by computer, was predicted to cost the
                            world economy
                            $6 trillion USD in 2021, and is increasing at a rate of 15% per year. Since 2021, malware
                            has been
                            designed to target computer systems that run critical infrastructure such as the electricity
                            distribution network.
                            The defense strategies against malware differ according to the type of malware but most can
                            be thwarted
                            by installing antivirus software, firewalls, applying regular patches to reduce zero-day
                            attacks,
                            securing networks from intrusion, having regular backups and isolating infected systems.
                            Malware is now
                            being designed to evade antivirus software detection algorithms. <br>
                            Malware can reveal itself with many different aberrant behaviors. Here are a few telltale
                            signs that you
                            have malware on your system:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your computer slows down. One of malware's side effects is to reduce the speed of your
                                operating
                                system (OS), whether you're navigating the Internet or just using your local
                                applications, usage of
                                your system's resources appears abnormally high. You might even notice your computer's
                                fan whirring
                                away at full speed - a good indicator that something is taking up system resources in
                                the
                                background. This tends to happen when your computer has been roped into a botnet; i.e. a
                                network of
                                enslaved computers used to perform DoS(Denial of Service) attacks, blast out spam, or

                            <li>Your screen is inundated with annoying ads. Unexpected pop-up ads are a typical sign of
                                a malware

                                pop-ups usually come packaged with other hidden malware threats. So if you see something
                                akin to "

                                prize the ad promises, it will cost you plenty.</li>
                            <li>Your antivirus product stops working and you cannot turn it back on, leaving you
                                unprotected against
                                the sneaky malware that disabled it.</li>
                            <li>Even if everything seems to be working just fine on your system, don't get complacent,
                                because no
                                news isn't necessarily good news. Powerful malware can hide deep in your computer,

                                detection, and going about its dirty business without raising any red flags. It really

                            believe that they are directly communicating with each other, as the attacker has inserted
                            themselves between the two parties. One example of a MITM attack is active eavesdropping, in
                            which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages
                            between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private
                            connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. The attacker
                            must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject
                            new ones. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within the
                            reception range of an unencrypted Wi-Fi access point could insert themselves as a
                            man-in-the-middle. As it aims to circumvent mutual authentication, a MITM attack can succeed
                            only when the attacker impersonates each endpoint sufficiently well to satisfy their
                            expectations. Most cryptographic protocols include some form of endpoint authentication
                            specifically to prevent MITM attacks. For example, TLS can authenticate one or both parties
                            using a mutually trusted certificate authority. <br>MITM attacks can be prevented or
                            detected by two means: authentication and tamper detection. Authentication provides some
                            degree of certainty that a given message has come from a legitimate source. Tamper detection
                            merely shows evidence that a message may have been altered.

                <p>
                    Ethical hacking is an authorized practice of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or
                    organization's infrastructure and bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and
                    threats in a network. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that
                    malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They can improve the security footprint to withstand
                    attacks better or divert them.<br>
                    The company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security engineers to perform such
                    activities in order to test the system's defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is
                    planned, approved, and more importantly, legal.
                    <br><br>
                <div id="ethhack" style="display: none;">
                    The term 'Hacker' was coined to describe experts who used their skills to re-develop mainframe
                    systems,
                    increasing their efficiency and allowing them to multi-task. Nowadays, the term routinely describes
                    skilled programmers who gain unauthorized access into computer systems by exploiting weaknesses or
                    using
                    bugs, motivated either by malice or mischief. For example, a hacker can create algorithms to crack
                    passwords, penetrate networks, or even disrupt network services. The primary motive of
                    malicious/unethical hacking involves stealing valuable information or financial gain. However, not
                    all
                    hacking is bad. This brings us to the second type of hacking: <strong>Ethical hacking</strong>. <br>
                    Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can
                    exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze the information to figure out ways to strengthen the
                    security of the system/network/applications. By doing so, they can improve the security footprint so
                    that it can better withstand attacks or divert them.
                    Ethical hackers are hired by organizations to look into the vulnerabilities of their systems and
                    networks and develop solutions to prevent data breaches. Consider it a high-tech permutation of the
                    old
                    saying “It takes a thief to catch a thief.” <br><br>

                    They check for key vulnerabilities include but are not limited to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Injection attacks</li>
                        <li>Changes in security settings</li>
                        <li>Exposure of sensitive data</li>
                        <li>Breach in authentication protocols</li>
                        <li>Components used in the system or network that may be used as access points</li>
                    </ol><br>
                    The practice of ethical hacking is called “White Hat” hacking, and those who perform it are called
                    White Hat
                    hackers. In contrast to Ethical Hacking, “Black Hat” hacking describes practices involving security
                    violations. The Black Hat hackers use illegal techniques to compromise the system or destroy
                    information.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Ethical Hackers must follow certain guidelines in order to perform hacking legally. A good
                        hacker
                        knows his
                        or her responsibility and adheres to all of the ethical guidelines. Here are the most important
                        rules of
                        Ethical Hacking:</strong>
                    <ul type="square">
                        <li>An ethical hacker must seek authorization from the organization that owns the system.
                            Hackers should
                            obtain
                            complete approval before performing any security assessment on the system or network. </li>
                        <li>Determine the scope of their assessment and make known their plan to the organization.</li>
                        <li>Report any security breaches and vulnerabilities found in the system or network.</li>
                        <li>Keep their discoveries confidential. As their purpose is to secure the system or network,
                            ethical
                            hackers
                            should agree to and respect their non-disclosure agreement.</li>
                        <li>Erase all traces of the hack after checking the system for any vulnerability. It prevents
                            malicious
                            hackers
                            from entering the system through the identified loopholes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h4>KEY BENEFITS OF ETHICAL HACKING :</h4>
                    Learning ethical hacking involves studying the mindset and techniques of black hat hackers and
                    testers to
                    learn how to identify and correct vulnerabilities within networks. Studying ethical hacking can be
                    applied
                    by security pros across industries and in a multitude of sectors. This sphere includes network
                    defender,
                    risk management, and quality assurance tester.
                    <br>
                    However, the most obvious benefit of learning ethical hacking is its potential to inform and improve
                    and
                    defend corporate networks. The primary threat to any organization's security is a hacker: learning,
                    understanding, and implementing how hackers operate can help network defenders prioritize potential
                    risks
                    and learn how to remediate them best. Additionally, getting ethical hacking training or
                    certifications can
                    benefit those who are seeking a new role in the security realm or those wanting to demonstrate
                    skills and
                    quality to their organization.
                    <h4>SKILLS REQUIRED TO BECOME AN ETHICAL HACKER :</h4>
                    An ethical hacker should have in-depth knowledge about all the systems, networks, program codes,
                    security
                    measures, etc. to perform hacking efficiently. Some of these skills include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Knowledge of programming - It is required for security professionals working in the field of
                            application
                            security and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
                        <li>Scripting knowledge - This is required for professionals dealing with network-based attacks
                            and
                            host-based
                            attacks.
                        <li>Networking skills - This skill is important because threats mostly originate from networks.
                            You
                            should know
                            about all of the devices present in the network, how they are connected, and how to identify
                            if they
                            are
                            compromised.
                        <li>Understanding of databases - Attacks are mostly targeted at databases. Knowledge of database
                            management
                            systems such as SQL will help you to effectively inspect operations carried out in
                            databases.
                        <li>Knowledge of multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, etc.
                        <li>The ability to work with different hacking tools available in the market.
                        <li>Knowledge of search engines and servers.
                    </ul>
                    <h4>ETHICAL HACKING TECHNIQUES :</h4>
                    Ethical hackers generally use the same hacking skills that malicious actors use to attack
                    enterprises. They
                    use a form of reverse-engineering to imagine scenarios that could compromise business and
                    operational data.
                    The varied techniques and tools are part of an overall vulnerability assessment the ethical hacker
                    performs
                    on a client's behalf. <br>

                    Some of these hacking techniques include the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>scanning ports to find vulnerabilities with port scanning tools, such as Nmap,
                            Nessus,Wireshark and
                            others,
                            looking at a company's systems, identifying open ports, studying the vulnerabilities of each
                            port
                            and
                            recommending remedial action.
                        <li>scrutinizing patch installation processes to be sure that the updated software doesn't
                            introduce new
                            vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
                        <li>performing network traffic analysis and sniffing by using appropriate tools.
                        <li>attempting to evade intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, honeypots and
                            firewalls.
                        <li>testing methods to detect Structured Query Language injection to ensure malicious hackers
                            can't
                            introduce
                            security exploits that expose sensitive information contained in SQL-based relational
                            databases.
                    </ul>

                    A study sampling 53,000 email users in more than 100 countries found that professional red teamers
                    generated a click rate of 4.2%, while ChatGPT-generated emails induced just a 2.9% click rate.The
                    researchers said the evidence supports the argument that — at least for now — humans remain superior
                    at tricking other humans. It also found that users with higher security awareness displayed were
                    better at spotting phishing emails by both human and ChatGPT-generated emails, with failure rates
                    dropping from more than 14% with less trained users to between 2% to 4% with experienced users...

                            claims</u></h4>
                    The threat actor allegedly threatened to go after a staggering 2,000 government targets in the Asian
                    nation - and has now begun to act on that after hacking into the Korean Research Institute for
                    Construction Policy and 11 other target organizations, Donga newspaper said. The suspected partisan
                    group, which is rather perversely called the Cyber Security Team, is thought to be based in China.
                    It's believed to be behind the attacks on January 25 that led to a dozen university websites being
                    defaced with the slogan: “Announcing invasion of the South Korean internet.”... <br>

                    <h4><u>Chinese hackers target Indian power grid assets in Ladakh</u></h4>
                    Chinese state-sponsored hackers had targeted India's power grids in Ladakh possibly for information
                    on India's critical infrastructure or to prepare for sabotage in the future, according to the
                    American cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. The activity was identified through a combination of
                    large-scale automated network traffic analytics and expert analysis. According to the report, this
                    targeting is likely a long-term strategic priority for select Chinese state-sponsored threat actors
                    active within India... <br>

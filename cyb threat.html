                A cyberattack is any offensive maneuver that targets computer information systems, computer
                networks, infrastructures, personal computer devices, or smartphones. An attacker is a person or
                process that attempts to access data, functions, or other restricted areas of the system without
                authorization, potentially with malicious intent. Depending on the context, cyberattacks can be part
                of cyber warfare or cyberterrorism. A cyberattack can be employed by sovereign states, individuals,
                groups, societies or organisations and it may originate from an anonymous source. A product that
                facilitates a cyberattack is sometimes called a cyber weapon. Cyber attacks have increased with an
                alarming rate for the last few years. <br><br>
                Most common cyber threats include- Malware, Phishing, Social engineering attacks, Ransomware, DOS
                attacks, MITM Attacks, etc.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        Malware is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server,
                        client, or
                        computer network, leak private information, gain
                        unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which
                        unknowingly
                        interferes with the user's computer security and privacy. Researchers tend to classify
                        malware into one or more sub-types (i.e. computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware,
                        spyware,
                        adware, rogue software, wiper and keyloggers).

                        Malware poses serious problems to individuals and businesses on the Internet. According to
                        Symantec's 2018 Internet Security Threat Report (ISTR), malware variants number has
                        increased to
                        669,947,865 in 2017, which is twice as many malware variants as in 2016. Cybercrime, which
                        includes
                        malware attacks as well as other crimes committed by computer, was predicted to cost the
                        world economy
                        $6 trillion USD in 2021, and is increasing at a rate of 15% per year. Since 2021, malware
                        has been
                        designed to target computer systems that run critical infrastructure such as the electricity
                        distribution network.
                        The defense strategies against malware differ according to the type of malware but most can
                        be thwarted
                        by installing antivirus software, firewalls, applying regular patches to reduce zero-day
                        attacks,
                        securing networks from intrusion, having regular backups and isolating infected systems.
                        Malware is now
                        being designed to evade antivirus software detection algorithms. <br>
                        Malware can reveal itself with many different aberrant behaviors. Here are a few telltale
                        signs that you
                        have malware on your system:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your computer slows down. One of malware's side effects is to reduce the speed of your
                            operating
                            system (OS), whether you're navigating the Internet or just using your local
                            applications, usage of
                            your system's resources appears abnormally high. You might even notice your computer's
                            fan whirring
                            away at full speed - a good indicator that something is taking up system resources in
                            the
                            background. This tends to happen when your computer has been roped into a botnet; i.e. a
                            network of
                            enslaved computers used to perform DoS(Denial of Service) attacks, blast out spam, or
                            mine
                            cryptocurrency.</li>
                        <li>Your system crashes. This can come as a freeze or a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death), the
                            latter occurs
                            on Windows systems after encountering a fatal error.</li>
                        <li>You notice a mysterious loss of disk space. This could be due to a bloated malware
                            squatter, hiding
                            in your hard drive also known as bundleware.</li>
                        <li>Your screen is inundated with annoying ads. Unexpected pop-up ads are a typical sign of
                            a malware
                            infection. They're especially associated with a form of malware known as adware. What's
                            more,
                            pop-ups usually come packaged with other hidden malware threats. So if you see something
                            akin to "
                            CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE WON A FREE PSYCHIC READING! " in a pop-up, don't click on it.
                            Whatever free
                            prize the ad promises, it will cost you plenty.</li>
                        <li>Your antivirus product stops working and you cannot turn it back on, leaving you
                            unprotected against
                            the sneaky malware that disabled it.</li>
                        <li>Even if everything seems to be working just fine on your system, don't get complacent,
                            because no
                            news isn't necessarily good news. Powerful malware can hide deep in your computer,
                            evading
                            detection, and going about its dirty business without raising any red flags. It really

                    <P>
                        Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system
                        until a sum of
                        money is paid. is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the
                        victim's personal
                        data or permanently block access to it unless a ransom is paid off. While some simple
                        ransomware may
                        lock the system without damaging any files, more advanced malware uses a technique called
                        cryptoviral
                        extortion. It encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom
                        payment to
                        decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files
                        without the
                        decryption key is an intractable problem - and difficult to trace digital currencies such as
                        paysafecard
                        or Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are used for the ransoms, making tracing and

                        Ransomware attacks are typically carried out using a Trojan disguised as a legitimate file

                    <p>
                        In cryptography and computer security, a man-in-the-middle, monster-in-the-middle,
                        machine-in-the-middle, meddler-in-the-middle, manipulator-in-the-middle (MITM),
                        person-in-the-middle (PITM) or adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) attack is a cyberattack where
                        the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who
                        believe that they are directly communicating with each other, as the attacker has inserted
                        themselves between the two parties. One example of a MITM attack is active eavesdropping, in
                        which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages
                        between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private
                        connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. The attacker
                        must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject
                        new ones. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within the
                        reception range of an unencrypted Wi-Fi access point could insert themselves as a
                        man-in-the-middle. As it aims to circumvent mutual authentication, a MITM attack can succeed
                        only when the attacker impersonates each endpoint sufficiently well to satisfy their
                        expectations. Most cryptographic protocols include some form of endpoint authentication
                        specifically to prevent MITM attacks. For example, TLS can authenticate one or both parties
                        using a mutually trusted certificate authority. <br>MITM attacks can be prevented or
                        detected by two means: authentication and tamper detection. Authentication provides some
                        degree of certainty that a given message has come from a legitimate source. Tamper detection
                        merely shows evidence that a message may have been altered.
